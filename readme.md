# PyO3 (Rust) interface to geomeTRIC (molecular structure geometry optimization program)

**This repository is under construction.**

Currently, for a proof-of-existance working example, see [model_driver.rs](examples/model_driver.rs) for more detail. This corresponds to the geomeTRIC example of [custom engine](https://github.com/leeping/geomeTRIC/blob/master/geometric/tests/test_customengine.py).
